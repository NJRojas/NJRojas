I’m a Software Engineer who enjoys building clean, reliable, and user-friendly iOS applications. I’ve worked across the aerospace, banking, automotive, marketing, and telecom industries in Germany, creating apps that support real people in meaningful ways.
✨ A great motivation for me are projects that genuinely improve people’s lives — that’s where technology makes sense.
I care about writing maintainable code, designing simple architectures, and collaborating with teams in a kind, honest, and productive way. My focus is always on building something useful, understandable, and a little better than yesterday.
